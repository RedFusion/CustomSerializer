Develop your own implementation serializer data, satisfying the following conditions:
 - Compactness of the resulting data serialization.
 - Serialization full object graph.

The solution must include the application, allowing visually see the outcome of serializing and deserializing data.
Implementation of the test application may be performed using any type of graphic application, i.e. You can use the console application and full GUI.

Do not use the standard serializers, for example BinaryFormatter, ObjectOutputStream etc.
